    <span id="prvspan">In general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established.
         The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points</span>
    <span id="vtorspan">With the Prior Analytics, Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,
         and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic.
         Kant stated in the Critique of Pure Reason that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.</span>
    <span id="tretspan">Aristotle's "natural philosophy" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics,
         biology and other natural sciences.</span>
    <span id="cetvrtspan">In his On Generation and Corruption, Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles,
         earth, water, air, and fire, to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry.</span>
